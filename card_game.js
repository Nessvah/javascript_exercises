//TODO: Switch + If Else

// In a simple card game, each player draws a card from a deck and the player with the higher card wins.
// Cards are ranked from 2 to Ace (Ace is the highest).

// Write a function compareCards(card1, card2) that takes two card values as strings
// ("2", "3", ..., "10", "J", "Q", "K", "A") and returns "Card 1 wins", "Card 2 wins", or
// "It's a tie" based on which card is higher.

// This function will have two switch statements: one for card1 and one for card2. Each
// switch statement should assign a score to the card based on its rank
// (e.g., "2" is 2, "3" is 3, ..., "10" is 10, "J" is 11, "Q" is 12, "K" is 13, "A" is 14).

const CARD_VALUES = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, "J", "Q", "K", "A"];

function compareCards(card1, card2){
