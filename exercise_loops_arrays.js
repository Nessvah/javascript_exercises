/** TODO: Exercise 0 - Given an array of integers, write a program to calculate the sum of all the numbers
*in the array. The program should also calculate the average of the numbers in the array and find the largest number."
*
*Let's assume we have the array numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60];
*
*Implement this exercise with For, While, Do-while and For...of loops.
*You can also try to implement with array built-in functions as reduce and forEach.
*Check also the Math.max method to find the biggest number in an array.
